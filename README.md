EVE Online 3D Map Route Finder 🚀
This project allows users to calculate the optimal route between solar systems in the EVE Online 3D map. The user can choose between three different routing options:

Secure Route 🟢 – Prioritizes high-security systems (High-Sec) to minimize risk.
Less Secure Route 🔴 – Prefers low-security and null-sec systems for faster travel.
Shortest Route ⚡ – Finds the path with the fewest jumps, regardless of security.
🔍 How It Works?
The route calculation is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, utilizing a heap-based priority queue for efficiency.

⚙️ Features:
✅ Efficient route calculation using graph-based search.
✅ Security-aware pathfinding to suit different player preferences.
✅ Real-time 3D map integration (if applicable).

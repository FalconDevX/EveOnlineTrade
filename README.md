<h1>EVE Online 3D Map Route Finder 🚀</h1>

<p>This project allows users to calculate the optimal route between solar systems in the <strong>EVE Online 3D map</strong>. The user can choose between three different routing options:</p>

<h2>🛣 Routing Options</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Route 🟢</strong> – Prioritizes high-security systems (High-Sec) to minimize risk.</li>
<li><strong>Less Secure Route 🔴</strong> – Prefers low-security and null-sec systems for faster travel.</li>
<li><strong>Shortest Route ⚡</strong> – Finds the path with the fewest jumps, regardless of security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 How It Works?</h2>
<p>The route calculation is based on <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong>, utilizing a heap-based priority queue for efficiency.</p>

<h2>⚙️ Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Efficient route calculation</strong> using graph-based search.</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Security-aware pathfinding</strong> to suit different player preferences.</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Real-time 3D map integration</strong> <em>(if applicable)</em>.</li>
</ul>
